It is the total power output of all the stars' particles of energy (photons) that we can see and detect. This isn't the same thing as luminance, which refers to the brightness or intensity of a surface illuminated by light. Luminosity is the primary measure used in astronomy and astrophysics to understand how starlight travels through space.",
